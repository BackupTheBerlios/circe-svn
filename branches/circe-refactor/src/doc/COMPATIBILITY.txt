~ Known Working IRCds

 - Hyperion (Freenode's IRCd) works fine in all of our testing.
 - Charybdis (Atheme's IRCd) works mostly in the limited testing conducted, with
   the following outstanding issues:
    ! - When joining Channels, Charybdis sends the topic, and then Circe sends the 
        topic command. This results in two topic headers when you join a channel.
