Circe
------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.0.3 alpha 4

Thanks for downloading this early release of Circe.
Circe at its current state is not practical to use due to its many limitations
and its untestedness. Even so, we would appreciate feedback.

As most OSS projects, we're short-handed. So if you enjoy coding Python and
have some spare time please consider joining the team.

Requirements:
 * Python 2.3 or newer           http://www.python.org
 * wxPython 2.6 or newer         http://www.wxpython.org
 * python-irclib 0.4.4 or newer  http://python-irclib.sourceforge.net

We currently do not prioritize backwards compatibility. Should we break
backwards compatibility somewhere please inform us about it.

Installing Circe:
 * Run "python setup.py install" to install Circe. It will prompt for permission to install a desktop icon (will be 
asked only under Linux systems).

Starting Circe:
 * Simply run "python bin/circe.py" (or navigate to bin, double click on circe.py under Windows)

These are the platforms Circe is known to work under:
 * Linux
 * Windows
 * FreeBSD

Known limitations:
 * Might not work on all IRC servers, see COMPATIBILTY.txt
 * Many commands not implemented.
 * Limited GUI.
