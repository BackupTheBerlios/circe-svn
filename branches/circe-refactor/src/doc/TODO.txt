Features projected for 0.0.3:
- Creating new server windows using the /newserver command.
- Adding a close button to every window.
  My idea is to add a 'titlebar' above every window_base subclass. This would
  have customisable contents (containing things like "#channelname - Topic"
  or "Chatting with User") and at least a Close button. Kind of like XChat.
  Accomplishing this might need a more structured inheritance of sizers
  throughout window_base and its subclasses.
- Removal of lorem.py (DONE)

Features projected for the future:
- (wxserver.py) In self.checkEvents() in WXServer add handling for missing
  events.
- add private messaging support (requires an addition to window_base.py)
- add plugins (requires a change of wxserver.py)
