{$appname} is an open-source {$acronyms.IRC} client written in <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a>.<br/>
When completed, {$appname} will offer all features found in modern {$acronyms.IRC} clients across multiple platforms.<br/>
<br/>
A list of projected features can be found <a href="{$index}?page=features">here</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
{$appname} is in serious need of developers! (currently me, anjel, is the only active developer)<br/>
If you have some free time to spare and are interested in open source development, please <a href="{$index}?page=development">help us</a>.<br/>
You don't have to be a coder to help us out, suggesting features, testing and giving feedback are also really appreciated. :)
