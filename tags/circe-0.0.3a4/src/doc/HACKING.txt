Hacking guide for Circe
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

October 2005

Author: Circe Development team

In order to contribute code, please abide by the following 
guidelines in order to make it easy on us:
  1. Do not file a bug against a stable release without first checking out trunk and confirming that the bug isn't fixed.
  2. Do not code against a stable release (i.e. one that is available for download and/or is tagged). Use the latest code
     from the trunk, or use a later tagged release instead.
  3. You must file a bug or feature request before you fix Circe or add to Circe (close the bug/feature request after).
     This helps with tracking and will help you substanially when you commit.
  4. You also must specify the bug/feature request number that you have done (if any) in the SVN commit message.

Bug filing guide

BEFORE you file a bug, please check the following:
  1. Have you tried checking out trunk and confirming that the bug isn't fixed?
  2. Is there a new stable release available? If so, did you download it?
If ALL the conditions still give you the same bug, file a bug.

Filing bugs -- what must be specified
  1. Circe version (OR revision) that you found the bug in.
  2. Specific bug.
  3. How to duplicate the bug (step by step).
