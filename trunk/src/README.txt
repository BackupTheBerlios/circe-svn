Circe
------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.03 alpha 1

Thanks for downloading this early release of Circe.
Circe at its current state is not practical to use due to its many limitations
and its untestedness. Even so, we would appreciate feedback.

As most OSS projects, we're short-handed. So if you enjoy coding Python and
have some spare time please consider joining the team.

Requirements:
 * Python 2.3 or newer           http://www.python.org
 * wxPython 2.6 or newer         http://www.wxpython.org
 * python-irclib 0.4.4 or newer  http://python-irclib.sourceforge.net

Starting Circe:
 * Simply run "python circe.py" or double-click it. :)

Known limitations:
 * Only two fixed status windows.
 * Might not work on all IRC servers, freenode is confirmed to work.
 * Many commands not implemented.
