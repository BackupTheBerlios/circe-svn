Circe
------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.0.3 alpha 3

Thanks for downloading this early release of Circe.
Circe at its current state is not practical to use due to its many limitations
and its untestedness. Even so, we would appreciate feedback.

As most OSS projects, we're short-handed. So if you enjoy coding Python and
have some spare time please consider joining the team.

Requirements:
 * Python 2.3 or newer           http://www.python.org
 * wxPython 2.6 or newer         http://www.wxpython.org
 * python-irclib 0.4.4 or newer  http://python-irclib.sourceforge.net
We currently do not prioritize backwards compatibility. Should we break
backwards compatibility somewhere please inform us about it.

Installing Circe:
 * Run "python setup.py install" to install Circe.
Starting Circe:
 * Simply run "python circe.py" or double-click it. :)

These are the platforms Circe is known to work under:
 * Linux
 * Windows

Known limitations:
 * Might not work on all IRC servers, freenode is confirmed to work.
 * Many commands not implemented.
 * Limited GUI.
